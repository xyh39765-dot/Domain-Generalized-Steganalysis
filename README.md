domain-Generalized Steganalysis: Combating Dual Mismatches with Vertical Splicing Augmentation and Few-Shot Metric Learning

## Abstract

In practical steganalysis applications, mismatch between training and testing stages are commonly observed, including **Cover Source Mismatch (CSM)**, **Steganographic Algorithm Mismatch (SAM)**, and **Payload Mismatch (PM)**. While existing research has extensively addressed the CSM problem, only limited efforts have been specifically dedicated to SAM and PM scenarios. 

At the same time, the rapid evolution of steganography makes it impractical to collect large-scale labeled data for every emerging algorithm, necessitating steganalyzers that can adapt to new domains with limited labeled samples. 

To bridge this gap, this paper proposes a novel steganalysis framework tailored for tackling SAM and PM issues, which integrates data augmentation and few-shot transfer fine-tuning strategies.
